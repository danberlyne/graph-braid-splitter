Instructions for entering your graph braid group data:

1. Navigate to the empty template in this file below the dotted line.

2. Enter the number of particles/strands in your braid group.

3. Enter the adjacency matrix of your graph, following the guidelines below:
- Enter each row of the matrix on a new line.
- Separate each column with a single space.
- Make sure your graph does not contain any loops or multi-edges.
- Additionally, if your graph braid group has n particles:
-- Make sure all cycles in your graph have length at least n+1.
-- Make sure all paths between vertices of degree not equal to 1 have length at least n-1.
(Not doing the last two steps will produce computations for RB_n(\Gamma) instead of B_n(\Gamma).)

4. Enter an initial configuration for your particles, following the guidelines below:
- Enter the row numbers (in the adjacency matrix) of the vertices of the graph that your particles start at.
- Separate each number with a space.
- Row numbering begins at 1.
- If your graph is connected, this can be left blank.
